# Project 3 - Yelp!

Yelp! is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [X] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Filters Page with additional filtering options (types of food)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would love to talk about other uses for the UIMapKit and extensions of the Yelp API to increase functionality.
2. Customizing the type of searching options.

## Notes

I encountered some problems learning the proper use of the delegates and writing protocols, but the conference calls and looking back over material helped a lot out with this and with transferring data using those protocols.
